Compiled and tested on OSX 10.7.4 with clang against gnu_static STL as
part of the r10C NDK.

These build parameters can be modified in Application.mk.

To build:

   Open up Android.mk and change the top two links to point to OSVR-core
   and libfunc top level dirs.

   e.g.

   OSVR_DIR=/Users/davidteitelbaum/sensics/OGVR-Core
   LIBFUNC_DIR=/Users/davidteitelbaum/sensics/libfunctionality

Then run 
     
     ndk-build clean all

Currently I'm building everything as static libs (except the plugin)
for ease of testing, but BUILD_STATIC_LIBRARY can be changed to
BUILD_SHARED_LIBRARY for .so generation. 

Output files should exists in libs/armeabi
