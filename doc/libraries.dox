/** @defgroup PluginKit PluginKit
    @brief The PluginKit library exposes a C API, with header-only C++ wrappers, to write plugins for the framework.

    All core functionality that can be accessed through the C++ API is possible to access through the C API as well. However, the C++ wrappers improve the usability of the interface and provide a safer development style. They can also greatly simplify your code and reduce the amount of "boilerplate" needed.

    See examples:
    - Comprehensive (auto-detects hardware and creates device): org_opengoggles_example_DummyDetectAndCreateAsync.cpp
    - org_opengoggles_example_NullPlugin.cpp
    - org_opengoggles_example_NullDevice.cpp
    - org_opengoggles_example_DummyAsync.cpp
    - org_opengoggles_example_DummySync.cpp
    - org_opengoggles_example_DummyHardwareDetect.cpp
    - org_opengoggles_example_DummyHardwareDetectCpp.cpp
    - org_opengoggles_example_DummyHardwareDetectCpp2.cpp

/** @defgroup ClientKit ClientKit
    @brief The ClientKit library exposes a C API, with header-only C++ wrappers, to write applications using the framework.

    Just as with @ref PluginKit, when possible, the C++ wrappers are recommended.

    See examples:

    - C++ wrapper-using:
        - MinimalInit.cpp
        - TrackerCallback.cpp
        - TrackerState.cpp
        - AnalogCallback.cpp
        - ButtonCallback.cpp
        - DisplayParameter.cpp
    - C-only:
        - MinimalInit.c
        - TrackerCallback.c
        - TrackerState.c
        - AnalogCallback.c
        - ButtonCallback.c
        - DisplayParameter.c

    This is not intended to be a full math library. It is expected that you convert the values in these structures into your own math types. If you do not yet have a math library, [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.net) is highly recommended.
